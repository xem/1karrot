 Can I Haz 1Karrot ?
=====================

Introduction:
-------------

The magician's rabbit has escaped the stage with its hat and is looking for his carrot in a strange forest...
In it doesn't appear nice, you can watch a video capture in ideal conditions here: https://youtu.be/Ai3IJGfBBWQ.
Controls: Arrow keys or WASD or ZQSD. (more info: https://goo.gl/H2PPd7)
Demo by Maxime Euzière (http://xem.github.io) for JS1k 2017, rendered only with CSS3D and emoji characters.
CSS3D engine inspired by https://goo.gl/6t6npT.
Optimized for running on latest Windows 10 and Webkit browsers (Chrome, Opera...)
also optimized to not explode on Firefox (but it's still a little glitchy).
also optimized to run on latest MacOS (10.2.3+), and on Safari (though MacOS emoji don't look very nice).
Linux users will see monochrome emoji or black squares, but they can install the Emoji One font
(Download https://goo.gl/J7GbE6 => right-click on the file => install as system font.)
This demo abuses HTML & CSS hacks to save space, and repeats a lot of code to optimize for RegPack.
This demo generates about 23kb of HTML code.

It contains exactly 100 CSS3D elements (the rabbit, hat, carrot, ground tiles, trees and animals),
because Firefox < 53 can't render more than 100 CSS3D elements correctly (and sadly Fx 53 releases in 2 months).
The demo is iframed on JS1k.com, so the global scope "top" is replaced with "this".
Elements with an id can be accessed as global vars, with `id` or `this["id"]` (more info: https://goo.gl/JNN6S5)

When the carrot is found and the surprise revealed, it's possible to return into the scene with a funny camera behavior.

Build process:
--------------

The content of the loop function is minified (2065 bytes) and sent to RegPack.
Regpack settings: do not rename vars "b q j", score: 1/0/0, longest strings first.
The packed code is 999 bytes long.
The end of the packed code "_=join(shift());eval(_)" is replaced with
"_=join(shift(q=u=d=l=r=f=0));setInterval(_,33)<3"
Which makes a total of 1024 bytes,
and the result is submitted to JS1k.

// INIT:

// Tree counter
q =

// Up / down / left / right keys pressed
u = d = l = r =

// Frame counter
f = 0;

// Game loop
// ---------

setInterval(e => {

// At the beginning of the demo, f == 0, then f is incremented at each frame.
// So the following code is executed once:
f ||
(

 // KEYBOARD INPUT

 /*
 The rabbit is controlled with the arrow keys, or WASD, or ZQSD.
 up (u), right (r), down (d) and left (l) are initialized at 0.
 When a key is down, one of these global vars is set to 1,
 according to the current keyCode (also called e.which).

 Dir.  | key | which | (which+3)%20
 ------+-----+-------+-----
 Up    | ↑   | 38    | 1
       | W   | 90    | 12
       | Z   | 87    | 10
 ------+-----+-------+----
 Right | →   | 39    | 2
       | D   | 68    | 11
 ------+-----+-------+----
 Down  | ↓   | 40    | 3
       | S   | 83    | 6
 ------+-----+-------+----
 Left  | ←   | 37    | 0
       | A   | 65    | 8
       | Q   | 81    | 4

 The string 'lurdl*d*l*ur*u' is built from each value of "(e.which+3)%20".
 When a key is down, the corresponding global is set to 1.
 When a key is up, it is set to 0.
 The code below can't be merged into:
 "onkeydown=onkeyup=e=>this[`lurdl*d*l*ur*u`[(e.which+3)%20]]^=1"
 Because multiple keydown events are triggered when a key is pressed for a few seconds.
 */
 onkeydown = e => this['lurdl*d*l*ur*u'[(e.which + 3) % 20]] = 1,
 onkeyup = e => this['lurdl*d*l*ur*u'[(e.which + 3) % 20]] = 0,
